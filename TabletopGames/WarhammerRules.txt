Two or more players take part in the game,
each fielding a group of units.
The size and composition of these groups, referred to as armies, 
are determined on a point system, with each unit (figurine) assigned 
a value in points roughly proportional to its worth on the battlefield; 
a better unit or model is worth more points. Before a game, the players 
agree on how many points will be used as the maximum army size and each 
assembles an army up to that limit. The composition of these armies is 
usually constrained by rules contained within the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook, 
as well as in several army-specific rulebooks called codexes. 
These rules and preparations are generally taken seriously among players.
Common game sizes are between 500 and 2,000 points and played on tables four 
feet in width and four to eight feet in length, but it is possible to play much larger games.
