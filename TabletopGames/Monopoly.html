<p>Monopoly is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game-board buying and trading properties,
and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, 
with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, 
and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. 
The game has numerous house rules and hundreds of different editions exist, in addition to many spin-offs and related media; 
Monopoly has become a part of international popular culture, having been locally licensed in more than 103 countries and printed in more than thirty-seven languages.</p>
<p>Monopoly is derived from The Landlord's Game, which was created by Elizabeth Magie in the United States in 1903 as 
a way to demonstrate that an economy which rewards wealth creation is better than one in which monopolists work under few constraints
 and to promote the economic theories of Henry George and in particular his ideas about taxation. 
 It was first published by Parker Brothers in 1935. The game is named after the economic concept of monopolyâ€”the domination of a market by a single entity. 
 It is owned and produced by the American game and toy company:
